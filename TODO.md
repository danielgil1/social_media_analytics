Done:
    ✔ [Daniel] Automation: Set up cluster using Ansible @done(19-04-25 01:39)
        Documentation can be seen in folder `/ansible`. If interested, read the `HOWTO`. Ansible is now installing the couchdb cluster but I haven't configured yet so I added another task to automate the configuration.
    ✔ [Daniel] Aurin: Find data from aurin and provide the dataset in csv file @done(19-04-25 01:39)
        Data is now in folder `/input`. If interested you can download the aurin project from `aurin` folder and import it in your own aurin portal. We need to have a meeting so I can explain the data and the topic I think we can cover with this.
New:
    ☐ [Fahmin/Kazi] Frontend: Set up a front end to show the findings. E.g. django or dash
    ☐ [Nafis] Backend: Set up flask to deliver content to frontend - Restul API
    ☐ [Fahmin] Setup couchdb cluster and know how to create views and be a master on couchdb
    ☐ [Kazi]: Twitter: Create harvester that can be parallelized and save data to couchdb 
    ☐ [Nafis]: Process the tweets using map reduce
    ☐ [Kun] Data analysis: Analyse contents of tweets of people that tweet a lot and try to find some correlation with mental health. Topic analysis / sentiment analysis ... research more.
    ☐ Create docker image ? 
    ☐ [Daniel] Add configurations in cluster installed by Ansible and make some tests
